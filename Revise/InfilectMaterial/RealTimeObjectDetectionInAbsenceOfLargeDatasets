AWS DeepLens:
=============
Creating and deploying a project templete on AWS deeplens
=========================================================
Goto deeplens, select project, select existing object detection templete and deploy to deeplens device, view output.

Extending a model with AWS deeplens:
============================================
1.Creating and deploying an AWS deeplens project.
2.Capture events from your AWS deeplens model and put them in a Queue for further processing.
3.There are many usecases to extend AWS deeplens models using AWS lambda functions(Eg: such as sending sms alerts, opening doors, populating analytical dashboards).

AWS deeplens>>Resources>>Devices>> select device from the list.
Select the MQTT topic name at the bottom(See the pic.)
Go to AWS greengrass>>Test..paste the MQTT topic name here. Subscribe to this topic.Verify you see some messages from the device.
Use the AWS greengrass console to create a rule to send messages to an sqs queue that is ready for polling.
Go to AWS greengrass>>Act>>Create a rule>> here go to actions section , select SQS queue.(see pic for other options)


Build a deeplens project with AWS Sagemaker
============================================
Create a model using AWS Sagemaker and importing into AWS deeplens.
AWS deeplens is a fully programmable video camera. It also comes with pretrained models.
1.How to setup a Sagemaker notebook instance
2.Import and configure an external notebook in Amazon Sagemaker.
3.Import model from Sagemaker into DeepLens.

Go to Sagemaker console, create a notebook instance, create an IAM role.The IAM role you will create will provide access to S3 bucket.
Import a model from github link it thru S3 bucket.
Import this model into AWS deeplens.
You can now include this in a project alongside an AWS lambda function and deploy it to your deeplens device for local inference.

Import models into projects and deploy into deeplens.

Using AWS IOT and a lambda function we are streaming the inference to the cloud, from there we 
are populating a dynamoDB table from where the amazon echo is reading and also we have a restful function which calls philips hue.

Lambda function:
Preprocessing , inference and output
