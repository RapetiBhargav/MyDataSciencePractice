Basic statistics from a data science perspective.

Having this kind of understanding is important because we can then choose and apply data science techniques that are the best fit for that shape of data.

Mean, mode, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient

Correlation Is Not Causation!

Statistical Features - Working With Box Plots:
===============================================
Percentile
let’s learn to interpret statistical features from plots.

Matplotlib’s boxplot()
Five-Number Summary #
Minimum value
Lower quartile (Q1/25th Percentile)
Median value (Q2/50th Percentile)
Upper quartile (Q3/75th Percentile)
Maximum value
The five-number summary is a useful measure of spread in the dataset.

Remember to make use of them while doing a preliminary investigation of a large dataset, when comparing two or more datasets, 
and when you need a descriptive analysis including data skewedness or outliers of your data.

Basics of Probability:
=======================
How Does Probability Fit in Data Science? #
Understanding the methods and models needed for data science, like logistic regression which we will encounter in the Machine Learning section, 
randomization in A/B testing, or experimental design, and sampling of data are examples of use-cases that require a good understanding of probability.

a. Independent Events
What is the probability of getting three 6s if we have 3 dice?
P(X and Y) = P(X) * P(Y)

b. Dependent Events
What is the probability of choosing two red cards in a deck of cards?
P(X and Y) = P(X) * P(Y after X has occurred)

c. Mutually Exclusive Events
P(X or Y) = P(X) + P(Y)
P(X and Y) = 0

d. Inclusive Events
P(X or Y) = P(X) + P(Y) − P(X and Y)

Conditional Probability:
Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.

P(X and Y) = P(Y|X)*P(X)

A very important, and extensively used, derivation from conditional probability is the famous Bayes Theorem.

Bayesian Statistics:
====================

P(X|Y)=P(Y|X)P(X)/P(Y)

What we have learned so far about probability falls into the category of Frequency Statistics. 
But there is another more powerful form of statistics as well, and it called Bayesian Statistics, or Bayesian Inference

it describes the probability of an event based on the previous knowledge of the conditions that might be related to the event. 
It allows us to answer questions like:

Has this happened before?
Is it likely, based on my knowledge of the situation, that it will happen?

Spam filtering based on a blacklist would be too restrictive and it would have a high false-positive rate, spam that goes undetected. 
Bayesian filtering can help by allowing the spam filter to learn from previous instances of spam. 
As we analyze the words in a message, we can compute its probability of being spam using Bayes’ Theorem. 
And as the filter gets trained with more and more messages, it updates the probabilities that certain words lead to spam messages. 
Bayesian Statistics takes into account previous evidence

basically a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

Probability Distributions - An Introduction:
============================================
if we have some missing values in our dataset, we can understand the distribution of our data using probability distributions 
and then replace missing values with the most likely values.

Probability Mass Function
Probability Density Function

Types of Distributions - Uniform, Bernoulli, and Binomial
=========================================================
The important thing is to be able to identify distributions from their graphs and to know their major properties and/or distinguishing features. 
For example, say you plot the distribution of an interesting variable in your dataset; you should be able to tell what kind of distribution that 
variable is following — is it Normal or Poisson or something else?

Uniform Distribution

The probabilities of success and failure do not need to be equally likely in Bernoulli distribution
Bernoulli distribution allowed us to represent experiments that have two outcomes but only a single trail. 
What if we have multiple trials? -->>Binomial Distribution

Types of Distributions - Normal
===============================
The number of standard deviations from the mean is also called the standard score or z-score. 
Z-scores are a way to compare results from a test to a “normal” population.

**VV.Imp**
This process of transforming a distribution to one with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called standardizing the distribution. 
Standardizing can help us make decisions about our data more easily.

Types of Distributions - Poisson and Exponential
================================================
Poisson Distribution:-->>Has Mass distribution
This distribution gives us the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time.

Poisson distributions can be used to make forecasts about the number of customers or sales on certain days or seasons of the year.

X, Poisson Random Variable, is the number of events in a time interval and P(X) is its probability distribution (probability mass function).

Exponential Distribution:-->>Has Density distribution
Exponential distribution allows us to go a step further from the Poisson distribution.
Say we are using Poisson to model the number of accidents in a given time period. 
What if we wanted to understand the time interval between the accidents?
It allows us to model the time in between each accident.

Some other examples of questions that can be answered by modeling waiting times:
How much time will go by before a major earthquake hits a certain area?
How long will a car component last before it needs replacement?

We can observe that the greater the rate of events, the faster the curve drops, and the lower the rate, the flatter the curve

Statistical Significance:
=========================
Statistical significance is a measure of whether our findings are meaningful or just a result of random chance.

Statistical significance can be broken down into three base components:

Hypothesis Testing
Normal Distribution
P-values
