Python offers multiple graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features. 
Matplotlib is the most popular library for creating visualizations in an easy way, 
so we are going to use it as a basis for learning the art of data visualization.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Available Styles:
-----------------
# Examples of available styles
plt.style.use('classic')
plt.style.use('ggplot') --->> ggplot is something similar to feel in R language 
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')
plt.style.use(['dark_background', 'presentation'])

Displaying Plots
----------------
If you are using Matplotlib from within a script, the function plt.show() is the way to go.

If you are working with a Jupyter notebook, plotting interactively within the notebook can be done with the %matplotlib command:

%matplotlib notebook will create interactive plots embedded within the notebook.
%matplotlib inline will create static images of your plots embedded in the notebook.

Saving Figures to File
----------------------
fig.savefig('figure.png')
