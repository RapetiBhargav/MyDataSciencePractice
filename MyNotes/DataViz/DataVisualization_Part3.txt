The importance of data visualization

Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
These are the tools we will focus on, 
but there are many others including Bokeh, ggpy, and D3.

Matplotlib is sort of the base plotting library in Python. Think of it as a low-level library that allows you to do all sorts of things

Seaborn was created to help deal with some of these issues. It is built on top of Matplotlib and in its own words, 
“provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.”

Types of plots:
Scatter
Bar
Distribution
Line
Heat map
